You will type your work into a notebook through your web browser, ed's servers will run your calculation and send you back the results. You can work anywhere with an internet connection, and all your data is saved and backed up. You can also download the notebooks and work on them locally if you want. You just need to make sure to upload material before the due dates.  \n",

    "I *highly recommend* completing the online introduction to Python: \n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python\n",
    "\n",
    "Do this sometime in the first week of class. This is an excellent online tutorial covering a lot of the basic programming principles from the Course Description. The course is 100% free and runs through the website. It only takes a few hours (probably 4-8 hours depending on your background). The exercise is not mandatory, but ***I will assume you have seen the material.*** I did the course myself a couple of years ago, I thought it was actually quite fun. I recommend it even if you have a lot of programming experience. \n",

    "\n",
    "* **Subject:** codecademy completion\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to encourage you prioritise learning Python over the other material at the beginning of the course.  The quiz will cover Python programming concepts, with only basic high-school or 1st-year math.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course will use 100% **Python3**. Codecademy offers courses using both Python2 and Python3. There is very little important difference between the versions. There are small things that might not make code backwards compatible. But either version is good for learning the basics ideas of Python. Inot sure, but I think you might have to pay for the more advanced courses; and possibly the Python3 version. ***I will give you the credit for doing either version.*** You are not required to pay anything, but you can if you like. \n",
    "\n",
    "A very large amount of the course will also likely have good wikipedia pages, a lot of online notes from other courses, and https://www.stackoverflow.com questions. If you have any questions about any of the material: GOOGLE IT FIRST. I'm not joking.  This is the #1 most effective thing the pros do that the amateurs don't.\n",

    "#### Background material\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't care much about specific of prerequisites. Most of the mathematical material I'll make sure to give a lot of the important background. However, I will assume you have at least *seen* the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Linear algebra: eg matrix multiplication, linear independence, determinants, inner products.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Fourier series: \n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = \\sum_{n} a_{n} e^{i n x} \\quad \\longleftrightarrow \\quad a_{n} = \\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\int f(x) e^{-i n x} \\mathrm{d}{x}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    Basics statistics: eg random numbers, Gaussian distribution, averaging, variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Basics Calculus: eg Taylor series, integration by parts, chain rule, multiplication rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you'll have seen some of these concepts. But I want you to make sure you *know them well*. Review them if you need. Math and computing are like cooking. Down deep, all you have is sugar, fat, salt, heat, stirring, chopping. But becoming a good chef requires know just how to putting things together in creative ways that work. In 1st & 2nd year, you should have learned to cook. Now you're going to learn how to make something someone else might want to pay for more than one time. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Books:** The course does not have an official book. A lot of the material can be found in a number of references. \n",
    "\n",
    "1) The most modern example that I can find is the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "        A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python (Langtangen)\n",
    "\n",
    "It has the huge advantage that it's available online: \n",
    "\n",
    "https://hplgit.github.io/primer.html/doc/pub/half/book.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "The book is very close in philosophy to our course\n",
    "\n",
    "2) My favourite for a long time is \n",
    "\n",
    "        Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing (Press, Teukolsky, Vetterling & Flannery)\n",
    "\n",
    "The book/online material comes with a lot of code in different languages; this isn't extremely useful. \n",
    "The descriptions and discussion of the algorithms are useful, clear, reasonably short, and sometimes quite funny. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Another great classic is:\n",
    "\n",
    "        Numerical Methods for Scientists and Engineers (R. W. Hamming)\n",
    "\n",
    "This has the advantage of being a Dover book, and is not very expensive."

    "This course will teach the basic principles of modern programming and computational analysis. We will use the programming language **Python** for all of our calculations. Python provides a very straightforward and efficient way to learn and implement basics programming concepts. It also has the benefit of a giant user community and a lot of great online resources for learning and troubleshooting. \n",
    "We will learn to use in a practical way the basic ingredients of *any* programming language, i.e.,\n",
    "\n",
    "    Syntax e.g.: ( ), versus [ ] , versus { }   .\n",
    "\n",
    "    Variables e.g.: float, complex, integer, string.\n",

    "    Control structures e.g.: for loops, while loops, if statements, functions.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Tools e.g.: notebooks, visualisation, external libraries, etc.\n",

    "There are a small handful of other similar principles that we will discuss occasionally; e.g.: memory management, optimisation and parallelism. But these are slightly more technical and not necessary to make a lot of progress.  Python makes learning and applying easy and quick without needing to fuss with too much tedious book keeping (e.g. FORTRAN, C/C++). It's more established than newer options (e.g. Julia). It's free and open source (unlike e.g. Matlab).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these concepts in Python, we will explore the fundamentals of computational/numerical analysis. We will learn the basics ingredients needed to solve *any* practical scientific computing problem.  Some key examples are:\n",

    "    How to represent floating-point decimal numbers on a computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "    The uses and dangers of iteration and recursion.\n",

    "    Sources and control of errors in computations. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Leveraging and computing linear operations on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These four principles form the foundation of virtually all mathematical computing problems. We will see the different ways to apply the basic principles in a series of topics and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The course will cover an overview of several different aspects of mathematical computing. These topics will sometimes be independent from each other. And sometimes they will have a lot of ideas in common. Many times, we will focus heavily on a topic not because that topic is extremely important all on its own. We will talk deeply about most topics *because they teach you important ideas about how to think about and solve difficult problems.* Expert problem solving is one of the most important and difficult skills in life. If you need to use computers to solve real-world problems, there are many excellent software libraries written by world experts.*And you should use these libraries*. This course will teach you a lot about how things work, when you should use an existing tool, and when you might need to make your own. \n",
